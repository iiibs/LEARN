# LEARN

 A program that trains an optimal neural network player, which learns from a perfect player how to play a simple board game (tic-tac-toe or OXXO) perfectly.\
 It can optimize the number of simulations and neurons used for the training, starting from the maximum and minimum values of them (min_games, max_games, min_neurons, max_neurons).
